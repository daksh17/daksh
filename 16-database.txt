RDS - Backup / Multi AZ / Read Replicas

	Automated Backup
		Full Recovery
		Point in Time Recovery
		Enabled by Default
		Backup Stored in S3
		Free space in S3 equal to size of RDS instance
		Backups are perfomed on scheduled basis on defined window
		During backup Storage I/O is suspended
		All Automated Backup will be deleted upon RDS delete. Admin will be prompted for one final backup

	Snapshots
		
		Manually or User Initiated
		Stored even when RDS is deleted
		Restored version will be on a new RDS with new endpoint

Multi AZ

	Allows to have exact copy of PROD data in another AZ
	AWS handles replication
	In case of primary site failure, RDS will automatically failover to standby
	No admin intervention required
	For Disaster Recover / Not for performance Improvement
	Available for all RDS now

Read Replica

	Read copy of PROD DB
	Improves read performance
	Can be used to configure to be accessed by different sources
	Read Replicas of Read replicas are possible
	Upto 5 Replica of PROD DB. For more, use read replicas of read replica (watch out for latency)
	Asynchronous replication
	Supported for MySQL, Postgre, MariaDB
	Must have Automatic Backup turned on
	You cant have read replicas that have Multi AZ
	Can be promoted to be its own DB. This will break replication
	Read Replica can be on second region for MySQL and Maria DB
	

Dynamo DB

	Fast and Flexible NoSQL Database
	Supports both document and key-value pair data model
	Stored on S3 across 3 Geographically distinct data center
